            <h1>Pinkinite</h1>

            <h2>What is this mod?</h2>
            <p>The Pinkinite mod adds a new set of building blocks to the game. It is extremely similar to quartz,
                but as you could probably tell from its name, it isn't white.</p>
            <h2>Why should I use it?</h2>
            <p>If you've ever been annoyed at the lack of colourful building blocks that have stairs then this mod is for you.
                If not, why are you still here?</p>
            <h2>Who are you, anyway?</h2>
            <p>I'm just a guy who likes pink maybe a bit more than is healthy :P. You can find me on Discord @DonaldDuckITH#8100.
